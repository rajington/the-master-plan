# 10 Steps Embracing Tech to Improve Society

> This is heavily a work-in-progress, currently a rough plan to address some tech problems in the form of a listicle. Highly subject to change, renaming, reordering. Each step is not worth challenging until validating earlier ideas, but worth disucssing altogether as a cohesive strategy.

## Schema Driven (_Technical_)

0. _language_ (**GraphQL**): a standard way to discuss data

1. _platform_ (**uno**): a data-centric platform, that can scale to all use cases

2. _collaboration_ (**web cha-cha-cha**): improve and leverage data sharing

3. _identity_ (**omni-factor**): authentication leveraging data networks

## Social Studies (_Societal_)

4. _society_ (**agora**): accuracy-incentivized and bubble-bursting debates

5. _competition_ (**gengine**): the economy for the meritocracy

6. _money_ (**rokocoin**): currency mined by sharing valuable data

7. _scripture_ (**bibles**): crowdsourced moral beliefs and practices for ethical conduct

## Conclusion

8. _leadership_ (**god**): not the "creator" but the conductor

9. _creation_ (**life**): why we are here, its purpose
